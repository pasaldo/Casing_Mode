# Casing Mode Mod for PAYDAY 2

## Overview
The **Casing Mode Mod** enhances the stealth experience in PAYDAY 2 by allowing players to perform additional actions while in observer mode (without a mask). These actions include running, crouching, and interacting with objects, providing more freedom to scout and plan during heists. The mod aims to improve gameplay immersion and utility in the preparation phase.

## Features
- **Run, crouch, and interact:** Players can move more freely without being restricted in observer mode.
- **Stay in character:** Remain undetected by NPCs while scouting.
- **Enhanced stealth mechanics:** Make better use of casing mode for planning your heist.

## Known Issues
- **Automatic detection by civilians:** When in the `Casing_Mode_Ticker_Clean` state, civilians detect the player automatically. This is a known bug currently under investigation.

## Installation
1. **Download the mod files.**
2. **Extract the contents** of the zip file to your PAYDAY 2 mods folder:
   ```
   PAYDAY 2\mods
   ```
3. **Launch PAYDAY 2** and ensure the mod is enabled in the BLT mod manager.

## Usage
- Enter a heist without equipping your mask to activate the observer mode.
- Utilize the enhanced controls to run, crouch, or interact with objects while scouting.
- Put on your mask to transition into active heist mode.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, try the following steps:
1. Verify the mod is installed in the correct directory.
2. Check for conflicts with other mods.
3. Ensure your PAYDAY 2 and BLT mod loader are up to date.

For persistent issues, feel free to open a ticket on the [mod's GitHub page](#).

## Future Updates
Planned improvements:
- Resolve the civilian auto-detection issue in `Casing_Mode_Ticker_Clean`.
- Optimize performance and compatibility with other mods.
